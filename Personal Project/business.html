                of your business growth will come from your business network.</p>

                                for a referral and request permission to use their name for an introduction. With a referred contact in hand and a trusted customer as back up, you can
                                then make your telephone call or send an email to gain an introduction and you will have a much greater chance of success in your introductory contact.

                             you jump into social media, you need to fully understand the medium, how it works, and how you can use it to benefit your business. LinkedIn is a great

                            <b>Know your Target Audience</b> - To reach your target audience, you must first define who is your target audience.
                            You can do this by building a consumer persona. A customer or buyer persona is a generalized representation of your ideal buyers.
                            Then you can market your brand and products only to those who are most likely to be genuinely interested in them. This means that
                            there will be higher chances of getting leads and conversions.
                            This will help you increase revenue by investing less.

                            Writing about topics that are of interest to your intended audience is a sure way of grabbing their attention.
                            The more targeted and relevant your content is, the easier it will be for you to reach your target audience and engage them.
                            Content marketing plays a major role in helping you generate leads and conversions.

                            <b>Survey your customers</b> - There are many ways to reach your target market more effectively and the first is to survey customers.
                            Surveying current customers you wish to target will give you a better idea about your product or service,
                            what’s missing from it and how you can improve it to make your customers more satisfied. Make sure you include not only your current
                            customers but anyone you think may be interested in what you offer and use the data you collect to shape your brand to better fit with
                            your target market.

                            yourself to influencers in your industry. Share content and interact with posts from other members in your industry.
